  <strong>EclipseTextures</strong> aims to give most of Balatro's textures a dark mode makeover, without many changes to the vanilla look.
</p>


## Installation

- Download [here](https://github.com/aleksxar/EclipseTextures/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or by clicking on the green `Code` button. Note that you need Steamodded to use the mod.
- While it's not recommended, you can also use the mod without a modloader by replacing the game files manually.
